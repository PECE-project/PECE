description: 'Annotating an artifact involves responding to a set of shared and evolving questions that are designed to elicit various viewpoints about the artifact. In the vocabulary of literature (the humanities field most akin to our tradition of anthropology), you can think of annotating an artifact as “reading” an artifact. Each reading, performed by different individuals, produces different interpretive insights that broaden and deepen the collaborative analysis of an artifact.'
