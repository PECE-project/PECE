  /* When stacking fields with inline labels in the Search Result Highlighter, the labels had a bottom margin of 8px. This was set via 

  .label:not(:last-child) {
      margin-bottom: var(--label-spacing);
  }

  When displayed, the field label right below each field label did not clear this bottom margin, and because they were also set to float left, the next field label was indenting to after the previous field label. 
  There may be a better way of fixing this problem, but this works for now.*/
