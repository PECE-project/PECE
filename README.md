# Platform for Experimental and Collaborative Ethnography (PECE)

PECE is a Free and Open Source (Drupal-based) digital platform that supports
multi-sited, cross-scale ethnographic and historical research. PECE is built
as a Drupal distribution to be improved and extended like any other Drupal project.

This repository contains the **development code** for PECE. It has work in progress which
is intended to be used by developers to suggest bug fixes and improvements,
as well as a starting point for customizations of the platform. If you are a
developer wishing to contribute to the development process, this is the
repository to use.

If you are an end-user looking for stable PECE releases, please access the repository
[PECE-distro](https://github.com/PECE-project/pece-distro), which contains our
installation package with the latest stable version. If you have general questions about
the platform, please refer to our [complete documentation](https://pece-project.github.io/drupal-pece/).

## Recommended setup

(Some later commands will reference DDEV; substitute the development environment

0. [Install Docker](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/docker-installation/) if you have not yet.
1. [Install DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/)

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PECE-project/drupal-pece.git --branch 2.x
cd drupal-pece
ddev composer install
ddev drush -y si pece --existing-config
ddev content-import-all
```

Note that the "[warning] â€¦ was not found" messages are addressed by the necessarily later `content-import-all` step.

## Updating Drupal Core

This project will attempt to keep all of your Drupal Core files up-to-date; the
project [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold)
is used to ensure that your scaffold files are updated every time drupal/core is
updated. If you customize any of the "scaffolding" files (commonly .htaccess),
you may need to merge conflicts if any of your modified files are updated in a
new release of Drupal core.

## FAQ

### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

We use the [composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra
section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
        }
    }
}
```

If the patch URL does not contain the Drupal.org node ID (AKA issue ID

### How do I compile SCSS to CSS?

From `web/themes/custom/peceful`, run `npm run build-bulma` or use this DDEV command:

```
ddev css
```

See more about Bulma's Sass in `web/themes/custom/peceful/README.md`
