About
=====================

The Platform for Experimental, Collaborative Ethnography (PECE) is a Free and Open Source (Drupal-based) digital platform that supports multi-sited, cross-scale ethnographic and historical research. PECE provides a place to archive and share primary data, facilitates analytic collaboration, and encourages experimentation with diverse modes of publication. The platform encourages humanities scholars to experiment with digitally-mediated, interdisciplinary collaboration, provides opportunities to involve students and practitioners in humanities research as it progresses, and quickens the public availability of humanities research in an open access form. PECE also enables experimentation with new forms of peer review for humanities research, and functions as a portal to a suite of open source tools useful for humanities research, including tools developed in data science for other scientific communities.

At its core, PECE is an experimental system. PECE’s design is both theoretically inflected and ethnographically grounded: platform design has been oriented by “design logics” drawn
from cultural, social, and language theories. We intend for the system to be as user-friendly as possible, but also acknowledge that conventional modes of knowledge organization tend to overdetermine the structure and meaning of knowledge, history, and culture. The way we have deliberately chosen to organize content in PECE may feel unfamiliar and disorienting to some, but we hope that in choosing to use PECE, you are as excited as we are to engage in this experiment.
