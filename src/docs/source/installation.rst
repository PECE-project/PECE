Installing PECE
###############

PECE is a Free Software-based Drupal distribution, therefore the standard installation procedure for Drupal applies to PECE with a few
extra dependencies. The distribution is generated through a ``Makefile`` which pulls all the dependencies and customizations for PECE.


Obtaining the Distro 
--------------------

Our distribution is being distributed as a tarball on Github. You can have access to the first release, v.1.0, here.

Alternatively, you can obtain the source code and build the distro yourself if you intend to help our team by fixing bugs and extending the platform for your research purposes. You can clone our public repository at:


Dependencies
------------

PECE has a few extra dependencies in addition to the basic dependencies of Drupal, which include:

All the platform-specific dependencies are generated in the build process of the distro, so you do not need to worry about them when downloading the tarball or cloning the repository with the source code. All the extra backend dependencies, however, must be configured by the person who is installing the platform.

Further Information

<https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/>`_.

PECE version 1.0 does not yet have a pre-configured virtual machine image distribution. It is in our plans to prepare one.
