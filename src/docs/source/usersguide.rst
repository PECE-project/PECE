   link at the bottom of the page. You can use the filter on this page to
   narrow the responses to a particular user or artifact.

4. From here, you can also navigate to the Structured Analytic page to see all
   of the questions in the ‘Structured Analytic’ (question set).

Content Glossary 
----------------

* Analytic: An analytic is a question designed to elicit various viewpoints
  about the artifact.  Questions can be categorized into Structured Analytics
  (named sets of questions).  

* Annotation: Annotating an artifact involves responding to a set of shared and
  evolving questions that are designed to elicit various viewpoints about the
  artifact.  In the vocabulary of literature (the humanities field most akin to
  our tradition of anthropology), you can think of annotating an artifact as
  “reading” an artifact.  Each reading, performed by different individuals,
  produces different interpretive insights that broaden and deepen the
  collaborative analysis of an artifact.

* Artifact: An artifact is the basic unit of data on PECE.  Artifacts represent
  materials that an ethnographer determines to be data relevant to the site;
  this can include documents, images, audio, videos, and web sites, which could
  include field notes, interviews, news articles, journal articles, films, etc.

* Artifact bundle: An artifact bundle is an artifact of artifacts.  You can
  create an artifact bundle to annotate a group of artifacts together.

* Fieldsite: A fieldsite is a reference to a certain geographic location where
  research will be conducted.  You can link artifacts to fieldsites to document
  where the artifact was found.

* Group: Groups are workspaces where several individuals can contribute
  content, write collaboratively, produce visuals, and publish essays.  

* Memo: A memo is a first draft of a piece of writing that may be published on
  the site.  Upon publishing a memo, that memo is opened for comments from the
  platform’s community.  

* Project:  A project designates a research project.  You can use this content
  type to describe when a project starts and ends, its institutional
  affiliation, and its funding source.

* Substantive Logic: Substantive logics document the rationale for running a
  particular instance of PECE or for conducting a particular research project.
  They can be associated with Projects or Groups.

Tagging Etiquette 
-----------------

Tagging is key to PECE because it facilitates showcasing the multiplicity of
perspectives surrounding any piece of content.  Any piece of content on the
platform can be tagged by any user on the platform with any term.  When users
navigate to the page for a tag, they will see, in a random order, everything on
the site that has been tagged with that term.  This further showcases the
multiplicity of perspectives surrounding the meaning of a term and facilitates
“chance encounters” amongst data that may not have otherwise been juxtaposed.
Because of this, we have ignored many of the “do’s/don’t’s” that come out of
the literature on collaborative tagging systems.  In order to make this work,
however, (and not spiral into total chaos), we recommend that you adhere to the
following rules of etiquette when tagging.

1. If your tag or something similar shows up in the Autocomplete function as
   you begin typing it, consider whether the existing tag will work to describe
   your content.  

        a. A goal of PECE is to show connections between disparate content
        through tags, and tagging several pieces of content with the same tag
        facilitates this.  However, we also recognize that it may be
        analytically significant to tag a piece of content with ‘knowledges’
        vs. ‘knowledge’ or ‘Truth’ vs. ‘truth’.

2. Tag each term separately rather than adding conjunction punctuation to show
   hierarchy.  

        a. There is no benefit on this platform to linking words together in a
        hierarchy.  For instance, there is no benefit on this platform to
        tagging an artifact with ‘Colors – Blue’ rather than tagging the
        artifact with both ‘Colors’ and ‘Blue’.  In fact tagging in the former
        is likely to inhibit others from stumbling across your content.

3. Tag any content with any terms that you deem appropriate (even if those
   terms conflict with the current tags for the content).

        a. Tagging is a key functionality behind facilitating “chance
        encounters” amongst disparate data on this platform.  Importantly,
        tagging fills the tag pages with content.  
	
        b. Tagging also allows the platform to capture the multiplicity of
        terms used to characterize a piece of content, which is a key design
        logic.
